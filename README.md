# HotzBox MIDI Interface

A web-based MIDI interface for translating keyboard inputs into MIDI signals, inspired by the Hotz MIDI Translator.

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/eb3024bb-b2a8-4a77-aace-49a8b2ea3a51

## Features

- **Real-time MIDI Translation**: Converts keyboard inputs into MIDI signals in real-time
- **Debug Console**: Built-in MIDI debug console to monitor MIDI events and messages
- **Interactive Interface**: Visual representation of the Hotz MIDI translator layout
- **WebMIDI Support**: Leverages the Web MIDI API for direct MIDI output
- **Customizable MIDI Output**: Select from available MIDI output devices
- **Event Monitoring**: Real-time logging of MIDI events, touches, and system messages

## Technical Details

This project uses the Web MIDI API to send MIDI signals directly from the browser. The interface includes:

- Vertical key columns for MIDI note input
- Real-time MIDI event monitoring through the built-in debug console
- Support for multiple MIDI output devices
- Color-coded event logging for different types of MIDI messages

## Browser Requirements

This application requires a browser that supports the Web MIDI API. Most modern browsers support this feature, including:
- Chrome
- Edge
- Opera

Safari and Firefox currently have limited or no support for Web MIDI API.
